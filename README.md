# AutoRestart
I tried many of the autorestart plugins out there, but all I could find were either too complex or tick based. This means they where not accurate when TPS drops below 20 and therefore not compatible with plugins like [Hibernate](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hibernate.4441/) and [Server Naptime](https://github.com/gvk/MinecraftPluginServerHibernate).

So I decided to create my own.

## Features
- Schedule automatic restarts at a specific time.
- Warning messages broadcasted to players before restart.
- Realtime based and not tick based for more accurate.
- Compatible with plugins like [Hibernate](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hibernate.4441/) and [Server Naptime](https://github.com/gvk/MinecraftPluginServerHibernate)

## Installation
1. Download `AutoRestart-x.x.x-jar` from the releases page.
2. Place the JAR file in the plugins folder of your server.
3. Start or restart the server.
4. Configure the plugin by editing the config.yml file in the plugins/AutoRestart folder.
